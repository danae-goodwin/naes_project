This project gives insight on plot interactive statistical plots such as box plots, histograms, density map, scatter matrix, violin plot, and contour plot using Plotly Express. Plotly Express is a powerful Python package that empowers anyone to create, manipulate and render graphical figures with very few lines of code. I showcase my knowledge in; the power of Plotly to generate interactive plots; and python programming fundamentals for interactive data visualization.
